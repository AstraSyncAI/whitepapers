# The Attribution Challenge: Clear, Present, and Solvable

Leading researchers from Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, and Johns Hopkins have crystallised what practitioners already know: we face a fundamental "attribution crisis" in AI agent deployment (Chan et al., 2025, "Infrastructure for AI Agents," Section 1.2). The core questions seem simple:

* Who created this agent?
* Who currently controls it?
* What can it actually do?
* Who bears responsibility for its actions?
* How do we provide recourse when harm occurs?

The inability to answer these questions reliably has real-world consequences.

## Documented Attribution Failures

**The Spotify Streaming Fraud (2024)**\
A North Carolina musician automated the creation and streaming of music through AI, generating over $10 million in fraudulent royalties obtained across a raft of streaming music platforms. The scheme involved:

* Multiple AI-generated musical compositions
* Coordinated bot networks for streaming
* Hundreds of fake listener accounts
* Undetectable until Spotify's financial forensics revealed the pattern (U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York, September 4, 2024, Case 24-CR-00456)
* Even with their sophisticated fraud detection capabilities, Spotify lost $60,000USD before detection

**Enterprise Shadow AI Proliferation**\
Microsoft's Work Trend Index 2024 revealed stunning statistics:

* 78% of AI users bring their own AI tools to work
* 65% do so without IT approval or knowledge
* Average enterprise has 127 unsanctioned AI tools in use (Microsoft Work Trend Index, November 2024, pp. 23-24)

**Malicious Model Distribution**\
Security firm HiddenLayer documented over 100 compromised language models on Hugging Face containing backdoors designed to:

* Execute arbitrary code on deployment
* Exfiltrate data to external servers
* Provide persistent access to compromised systems (HiddenLayer, "Supply Chain Attacks in ML," December 2024, Section 4.3)

## The Attribution Pattern

Each incident follows a predictable sequence:

1. Agent operates beyond intended parameters
2. Damage accumulates undetected
3. Discovery occurs through historical audit review, not real-time monitoring - leaving extended windows for ongoing impact
4. Forensic investigation reveals scope
5. No systematic prevention for next occurrence

We are essentially managing AI agents like we managed computer viruses in the 1990s, reactively, after damage occurs.
