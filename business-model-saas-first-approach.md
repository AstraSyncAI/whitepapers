# Business Model: SaaS-First Approach

AstraSync operates on a enterprise SaaS model:

**Subscription Tiers**

* **Starter**: Basic registration and verification
* **Professional**: Advanced monitoring and compliance tools
* **Enterprise**: Custom compliance frameworks, dedicated support
* **Sovereign**: Private chain deployment for government/military

**Revenue Streams**

* Subscription fees based on agent volume and features
* Implementation and consulting services
* Compliance certification programs
* Custom integration development

**Economic Incentives**

While not a token-focused project, AstraSync may utilize blockchain-native incentive mechanisms purely for network operations:

* Validator rewards for maintaining registry integrity
* Compliance verification incentives
* Data storage and retrieval fees
