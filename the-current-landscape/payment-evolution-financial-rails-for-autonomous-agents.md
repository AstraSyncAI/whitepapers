# Payment Evolution: Financial Rails for Autonomous Agents

The payment industry's rapid response to AI agents signals both opportunity and risk. Major providers are racing to enable autonomous transactions:

## Mastercard Agent Pay

Announced April 29, 2025, Mastercard's Agentic Payments Program extends proven tokenisation to AI agents:

**Technical Implementation:**

* Tokenised credentials preventing raw card exposure
* Granular spending controls by category and amount
* Real-time authorisation with human override capability
* Audit trails meeting regulatory requirements

"We're building on infrastructure that already secures billions in mobile payments daily. Agent Pay simply extends these capabilities to new actors" (Mastercard Press Release, April 29, 2025).

## Visa Intelligent Commerce

Visa's May 2025 announcement introduced payment passkeys for AI agents:

**Key Features:**

* Biometric-secured credential generation
* Merchant category restrictions
* Velocity controls preventing runaway spending
* Automated dispute resolution protocols

Early adoption metrics from Visa show 10,000+ merchants onboarded in first three weeks (Visa Quarterly Earnings Call, May 22, 2025, transcript p. 18).

## Google Shopping Intelligence

Google's May 21 announcement of AI Shopping Mode represents the next evolution:

* Preference learning from user behaviour
* Automated purchase within defined parameters
* Price monitoring and trigger-based execution
* Integration with Google Pay infrastructure

## The Governance Imperative

**Pre-Transaction Verification:**

* Ownership verification
* Compliance flag checking
* Spending authorisation validation

**Transaction Attribution:**

* Immutable linkage to verified humans
