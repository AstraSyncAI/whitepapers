# The Challenge: Ungoverned AI Agents

The explosion of autonomous AI agents presents unprecedented challenges:

**Identity Crisis**

* No universal, verifiable identity system exists for AI agents
* Agents can be copied, modified, and deployed with no traceability
* Traditional software licensing models don't account for autonomous behavior

**Compliance Complexity**

* Regulatory frameworks are emerging globally but lack technical implementation
* Cross-jurisdictional operations create compliance nightmares
* No standardized approach to AI agent accountability

**Trust Deficit**

* Enterprises hesitate to deploy agents without clear liability frameworks
* Consumers lack confidence in AI-driven decisions
* No mechanism to verify an agent's capabilities, limitations, or compliance status

**Accountability Gaps**

* When agents cause harm, attribution is difficult or impossible
* No audit trails for agent decisions and actions
* Limited recourse for affected parties
