# Technical Architecture

**Multi-Chain Foundation**

AstraSync is designed as a blockchain-agnostic platform, initially launching on a carefully selected high-performance chain before expanding to support multiple blockchains. This approach ensures:

* **Flexibility**: Organizations can choose chains that meet their specific regulatory or performance requirements
* **Future-Proofing**: As the blockchain ecosystem evolves, AstraSync can adapt without architectural overhaul
* **Private Chain Support**: Government and military applications can deploy on private, permissioned chains while maintaining interoperability with the public registry

**Key Components**

**Registry Layer**

* Decentralized storage of agent metadata
* Cryptographic proofs of registration and compliance
* Versioning and update tracking

**Verification Engine**

* Developer/organization KYC integration
* Agent capability verification
* Compliance rule engine

**Monitoring Infrastructure**

* Real-time behavior analysis
* Anomaly detection
* Compliance deviation alerts

**Data Management**

* Flexible storage architecture supporting both on-chain references and off-chain secure storage
* Encryption at rest and in transit
* Configurable retention policies
